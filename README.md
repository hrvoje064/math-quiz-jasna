Math quiz/training for grade 1,2,3, ... (elementary school)

This program came into being when my daughter started pre-school 2 years ago. Now she's 7 years old and is attending grade 2. Consequently the program has been extended by many new exercises, all as per material she has been learning in school.

The program now contains 5 arithmetic exercises; +/- (in 4 levels), multiplication/division table (adjustable from 5x5 to 12x12), 3 digit multiplication and division.

There are also many non arithmetic exercises; (Before, Between, After), (Odd, Even), Position Value, (>, =, <) integer and fractions, Sequence (4 levels), Fractions (3 levels), Clock (5 levels, involving +/- time), N->Roman, Roman->N, Change return ($ and Peso), Alphabetical sort (5 English words), skip+count, skip-count, GAPESA (text given mathematical problems involving + - * and /), and Perimeter/Area exercises.

Program is very simple to operate, and easy for parent to control later what was the child up to. Each exercise set (min 1, max 30 exercises) is allotted certain amount of time, and when exercises are completed, if time was exceeded, penalty (again certain number of exercises) is given. After that if there were any mistakes, again additional exercises are given.

Child very quickly learns that accuracy, and speed are important.

Program keeps the record of all exercises, and child's answers, black for correct answers, and red for errors. Several exercises (GAPESA, Perimeter/Area) print the correct equation for problem solution with the error message.

Provided here is source code (several Racket modules), developed using Racket 8.10/11. The program can be run directly from DrRacket, providing that all source files are placed in the same directory, but the easiest way is to install it as a Racket package. Open a DrRacket window, and click on Help->Package Manager... menu. Input math-quiz into the search-field and click install button.
