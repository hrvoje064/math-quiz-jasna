=========
Math quiz/training for grade 1,2,3, ... (elementary school)

This program came into being when my daughter started pre-school 2 years ago. Now she's 7 years old and is attending grade 2. Consequently the program has been extended by many new exercises, all as per material she has been learning in school. Several exercises, (mostly those at the end of the list), through multiple levels, go beyond 2nd grade, probably ending up in high school territory.

The program now contains 5 arithmetic exercises; 

    +/- (in 4 levels), 
    multiplication/division  table (adjustable from 5*5 to 12*12), 
    3 digit multiplication and division.

There are also numerous  non arithmetic exercises; 

    Comparison (>, =, <) in two levels - integers and fractions 
    Odd, Even
    Sequence (3 levels)
    Before, Between, After
    Position Value
    Graphical Fractions (3 levels)
    Clock (5 levels)
    Arabic->Roman 
    Roman->Arabic
    Money change USD
    Money change Philippine Peso
    Alphabetic sorting of English words
    Skip counting with skip ranging from 2-10
    Skip counting with negative skip from 2-10
    Missing X - find operand in simple arithmetic equations in 3 levels
    GAPESA - Text given math problems in 8 levels (+, -, +-, *, /, */)
    Perimeter/Area problems in 4 levels

Program is very simple to operate, and very easy for parent to control later what was the child up to. Each exercise set (min 1, max 30 exercises) is allotted certain amount of time, and when exercises are completed, if time was exceeded, penalty (again certain number of exercises) is given. After that if there were any mistakes, again additional exercises are given.

Child very quickly learns that accuracy,  and speed are important.

Program keeps the record of all exercises, and child's answers, black for correct answers, and red for errors.

Current version of math-quiz is 4.3

math-quiz is written in Scheme (Racket compiler v8.11)

Provided here is source code (several Racket modules), developed using Racket 8.10/11. The program can be run directly from DrRacket, providing that all source files are placed in the same directory, but the easiest way is to install it as a Racket package. Open a DrRacket window, and click on File->Package Manager... menu. Input math-quiz into the search-field and click install button.
